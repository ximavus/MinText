# read me please
This is a small script that uses the RaspberryJamMod/RaspberryJuice mod/plugin,
so to use the script you need to have the RaspberryJamMod/RaspberryJuice mod/plugin enabled.
You can get the RaspberryJamMod (mod) from here github.com/arpruss/raspberryjammod and you can get the RaspberryJuice (plugin) from here github.com/zhuowei/RaspberryJuice.
From RaspberryJuice you need the .jar for the version you are using from the jars folder.
From the RaspberryJamMod you need the .jar from the version you are using from the mods.zip folder.
After that you need to add the mod and the forge loader in the .minecraft/mods/(the version you are using)/ folder or if you use third-party launchers like MultiMC or PrismLauncher its simple enough that it doesn`t need explanation.
When you open the version of minecraft with the RaspberryJamMod/RaspberryJuice run the main.py file and BAM! You have python inside minecraft!
# Stuff you can do with it
You can basically control your computer with the os library and even open a browser or even use the mcpi library inside minecraft`s chat and because you can put a IP address and the RaspberryJamMod/RaspberryJuice port (defaulting to 4711) you can control e.g. LAN world from a diffrent world IN FULLSCREEN!
# Notes
instead of newline you need to use a pause symbol and a space after it.
also input() doesn`t work in the chat :P
