# read me please
This is a pretty minimalistic text editor I made
# To run (for all of the commands you need to be in the folder's directory)
## On linux do sudo `python3 minText.py` (sudo because it doesn't let you open and write files to save without sudo)
## On windows open the powershell as an administrator and run `python minText.py`
## On macOS same as linux
# Also you need to have the tkinter package
## To download it do `pip install tkinter` (on all OSes)
## If it doesn't work do `python -m venv .` and then use pip
## If it still doesn't work do sudo apt install python3-tk
